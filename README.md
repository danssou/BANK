# What I Have Learned from Building Hoobank

Working on Hoobank, a modern web application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, has been an enriching learning experience. This project has provided valuable insights into contemporary web development practices and tools.

## Key Learnings

Building Hoobank has deepened my understanding of React, including creating and managing components and using hooks for state and side effects. I discovered Vite, a build tool offering a faster and leaner development experience, and learned to set up and configure projects with it.

I mastered Tailwind CSS, learning to efficiently style React components with utility classes. Understanding PostCSS and integrating Autoprefixer to add vendor prefixes automatically has enhanced my CSS skills. Additionally, gaining experience with TypeScript has been beneficial, helping me ensure type safety and improve code quality in React projects.

## Getting Started

Working on Hoobank has enhanced my technical skills and broadened my understanding of modern web development practices. It has been an invaluable educational journey, providing practical experience with some of the most popular tools and frameworks in the industry today.
